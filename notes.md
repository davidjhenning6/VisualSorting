# Notes

### Goals
###### Musts
- create and implement 5 sorting algorithms in c#
    - bubble
    - merge 
    - insertion
    - quick
    - heap 
- to start will have fixed static arrays defined in methods
- eventually will take input from user
    - inputs required:
        - array length 
        - array type int
        - *input format* if i know length can have user input each then enter to reduce parsing
- create visual representation of sorting process
- hub menu creation(in console) enter 1-5 to select desired algorithm
- display basic output on command line
- move menu into methods

###### Nice To Haves
- could implement basic file i/o for practice
    - will have to set/chose some kind of standard for files
- could have sorts run asynchronously to "race" 
    - visually racing?

### To Do
- menu 
    - algo selection
- bubble sort implementation
    - display basic output on command line
    - move to array from list
    - merge sort
    - merge




- merge sort implementation
    - display basic output on command line

    - display basic output on command line
- quick sort implementation
    - display basic output on command line
- heap sort implementation
    - display basic output on command line
